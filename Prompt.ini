Create a personal website for Chunxin Tang with a typing animation style.
The vibe: cozy, retro, and creative — like listening to vinyl records while typing thoughts into a typewriter.

Homepage:

Big typewriter-style headline that appears with a typing effect:
“Hi, I’m Chunxin. I turn data into stories — and spin side projects like records.”
Subline that also types in: “Data analyst | Traveler | Photographer | Side-project tinkerer.”
Add a small animated record player or vinyl disc illustration as a design element.
Navigation: About, Projects, Blog, Photos, Contact.
About Page:

Keep text minimal, typed in with animation:
“Duke + CMU grad. Work at Nucor. Love beaches, books, painting, and outdoorer.”
Small retro illustrations or icons (record, camera, book).
Include 2–3 travel and art photos with Polaroid-style frames.
Projects Page:

Retro card design with a typewriter font for titles.
Each project as a short one-liner, no long text.
Examples:
Spotify Playlist Builder — “Turn screenshots into playlists.”
Blockchain Application in Fashion Industry — “Traceable clothes for sustainability”
Cloud Categorization — “ML in 3d data”
Blog Page:

Minimal layout with posts that open in a typewriter font.
Section title: “Notes I Typed Up.”
Photos Page:

Gallery in a film-strip or Polaroid style.
Categories: Travel, Everyday Aesthetics, Drawings.
Contact Page:

Contact form with placeholder text that types in: “Say hi…”
Fun footer line: “Spinning ideas since 2000
