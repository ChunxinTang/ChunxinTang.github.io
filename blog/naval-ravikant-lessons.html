                    <p class="post-intro">
                        In an age obsessed with success, Naval Ravikant‚Äîentrepreneur, investor, and co-founder of AngelList‚Äîasks a far more timeless question: What does it mean to truly live well?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        In a recent episode of the Modern Wisdom podcast, Naval distills decades of hard-won insight into a single, piercing message: Life is not a game you win‚Äîit's a game you learn to play with joy, clarity, and self-awareness.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Key Takeaways from the Conversation</h2>
                    
                    <h3>1. Success isn't free</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every achievement demands a trade-off. The question is‚Äîare you willing to pay the real price, which often includes time, peace, or relationships?
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>2. The root of unhappiness is internal</h3>
                    <p>
                        Naval believes most suffering stems from our own expectations, comparisons, and unresolved inner conflicts.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>3. You're allowed to be selfish</h3>
                    <p>
                        In fact, understanding your own needs and boundaries is the only way to genuinely contribute to others without resentment.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Money can buy happiness‚Äîbut only if you know how to spend it</h3>
                    <p>
                        Experiences over status. Health over luxury. Time over things.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Death and grief deserve honesty</h3>
                    <p>
                        Naval encourages us to face mortality head-on. Only then can we let go of trivial worries and live fully.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="post-quote">
                        "Don't defer happiness. Don't imagine that success will solve your suffering. Live now. Learn to be at peace in the present."
                    </div>
                    
                    <h2>Final Thought</h2>
                    <p>
                        Winning at life isn't about becoming someone else‚Äîit's about becoming deeply, unapologetically yourself. And if you're looking for a guide to help you unlearn the noise and reconnect with what truly matters, this episode is a good place to start.
                    </p>
