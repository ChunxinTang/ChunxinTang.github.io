Include 2–3 travel and art photos with Polaroid-style frames.
Projects Page:

Retro card design with a typewriter font for titles.
Each project as a short one-liner, no long text.
Examples:
Spotify Playlist Builder — “Turn screenshots into playlists.”
Blockchain Application in Fashion Industry — “Traceable clothes for sustainability”
Cloud Categorization — “ML in 3d data”

🎵 OCR-Powered Spotify Playlist Creator
From handwritten lists to Spotify playlists — instantly.

Built with Python (Flask), EasyOCR, and the Spotify Web API, this project lets users upload a photo or screenshot of handwritten or printed song lists — and automatically generates a Spotify playlist based on OCR-extracted text.

🔍 What it does:

Accepts images via a web/mobile interface

Uses EasyOCR to detect and extract song titles and artists

Matches each song to Spotify using the API

Creates a public Spotify playlist and returns the link

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Python (Flask API server)

EasyOCR (text recognition)

Spotipy (Spotify API wrapper)

React Native + Expo (mobile app interface)

Base64 image handling

CORS-enabled API endpoints

🌟 Why I Built It:
I often take photos of handwritten playlists or scribbled song recommendations from friends. This tool turns those moments into actual playlists — without the manual typing.

💡 Lessons Learned:

Handling inconsistent OCR outputs and fuzzy text

Managing Spotify OAuth flows and redirect URI challenges

Improving user experience with mobile-friendly design

Setting up a secure local API server (SSL certificates, certifi)

📱 Future Improvements:

More robust song parsing logic (for fuzzy formats)

Add song previews and album art to the UI

Publish as a real mobile app via Expo + App Store

Create a new project page for the Blockchain Application in the Fashion Industry. https://cscc.dukekunshan.edu.cn/2021-summer-student-research-project-feasibility-analysis-of-blockchain-technology-application-to-sustainable-consumption-in-china/

This should be added to the projects page of the website.
Content is exactly the same as the project page above.
Add a new project card to the projects page.
Make it the first project card (featured project).
Use the same design as the other project cards.
Use a small record icon for the project icon.
All projects should be added to the projects page.

Project: Blockchain Application in the Fashion Industry
Feasibility Analysis of Blockchain Technology in Sustainable Consumption (Duke Kunshan University Research Project)

During my time at Duke Kunshan University, I conducted research on how blockchain technology could 
transform sustainability practices in the fashion industry. The project examined blockchain’s potential to improve supply chain transparency, 
reduce waste, and empower consumers to make more informed choices. I focused on analyzing feasibility in the Chinese market, considering both technological challenges and consumer behavior.

This experience strengthened my ability to evaluate emerging technologies in real-world contexts, 
bridging environmental sustainability, consumer behavior, and digital innovation.

Project: DECIPHER: Going to Mars – Science, Society and Sustainability (2020–2021)
Bass Connections Team Research Project

Our Bass Connections team explored what it would take to establish a permanent settlement on Mars. We developed risk‑based decision scenarios for settlers and produced analysis and recommendations that drew on science, engineering, history, economics, ethics, law and international relations
bassconnections.duke.edu
. The research focused on habitats and community design, sustainability, international relations and security, and governance
bassconnections.duke.edu
. We shared our findings through a series of reports on equity and resource equality, inter‑state collaboration and investment, and risk mitigation topics such as contamination and medical challenges
bassconnections.duke.edu
. The project ran from summer 2020 to spring 2021 and led to the ongoing Duke Space Initiative
bassconnections.duke.edu
. This experience sharpened my ability to evaluate complex, multidisciplinary problems at the intersection of technology, society and sustainability.
Our Martian World

Team Output Website

Our Martian World is the public‑facing website produced by the DECIPHER team. It gathers the project’s analyses and recommendations on critical issues for Mars settlement — ranging from equity and resource equality to inter‑state collaboration and incentives, international investment and arbitration, commercial funding strategies, backward contamination safeguards and medical risk management
bassconnections.duke.edu
. The site serves as a hub for reports and other resources on how science, engineering, history, economics, law and ethics shape sustainable human settlement on Mars
bassconnections.duke.edu
. By exploring these multi‑disciplinary questions, we present actionable guidance for policymakers and future space settlers.

Best Practices for Going to Mars (2021 Fortin Foundation Bass Connections Virtual Showcase)

Virtual Showcase Presentation

This virtual showcase distilled our year‑long research into an accessible overview of best practices for Mars settlement. In addition to technical feasibility, we examined social, environmental, legal and ethical dimensions of establishing a Martian society
bassconnections.duke.edu
. Our analysis highlighted hidden risk trade‑offs and emphasized the need for inclusive governance, sustainable resource management and international cooperation. The presentation proposed “all‑things‑considered” best practices and flagged open questions for future research

Title:
What Does It Mean to Win at Life? Lessons from Naval Ravikant

Body:
In an age obsessed with success, Naval Ravikant—entrepreneur, investor, and co-founder of AngelList—asks a far more timeless question: What does it mean to truly live well?

In a recent episode of the Modern Wisdom podcast, Naval distills decades of hard-won insight into a single, piercing message: Life is not a game you win—it’s a game you learn to play with joy, clarity, and self-awareness.

Here are a few standout takeaways from the conversation:

Success isn't free. Every achievement demands a trade-off. The question is—are you willing to pay the real price, which often includes time, peace, or relationships?

The root of unhappiness is internal. Naval believes most suffering stems from our own expectations, comparisons, and unresolved inner conflicts.

You’re allowed to be selfish. In fact, understanding your own needs and boundaries is the only way to genuinely contribute to others without resentment.

Money can buy happiness—but only if you know how to spend it. Experiences over status. Health over luxury. Time over things.

Death and grief deserve honesty. Naval encourages us to face mortality head-on. Only then can we let go of trivial worries and live fully.

Perhaps the most powerful moment of the podcast was when Naval spoke to his younger self:

"Don’t defer happiness. Don’t imagine that success will solve your suffering. Live now. Learn to be at peace in the present."

Final Thought:
Winning at life isn't about becoming someone else—it’s about becoming deeply, unapologetically yourself. And if you’re looking for a guide to help you unlearn the noise and reconnect with what truly matters, this episode is a good place to start.
